Two agents are released from opposite corners of a room. Their goal is to reach the corner opposite to them by randomly choosing best possible moves in one case and any move in 
other case. On collison, -10 points are given to the one due to whom collison happened. Otherwise, on each successful move, +5 points are given to each. If one agent reaches the 
goal earlier, then points of other agent are deducted with each move. Finally, a graph is plotted between the relative performance of both agents and the number of moves. This 
system of reward and punishment is the key concept behind reinforcement learning.
